# Dixon Family History

A repository for Dixon family history, research and genealogy

As of May, 2015, this is an exploratory project only. My intentions are to determine the usefulness of GitHub for the following:

* Maintaining genealogy data in flat files
* Using GitHub Wiki pages for research collaboration
* Using GitHub's git for updating and maintaining data on people and relationships
* Using GitHub's project pages for displaying family information and data via a domain name

Initial thoughts and questions:

* Can a GEDCOM file be used as the database itself, edited and updated via git and branching?
* Can YAML and collections be used with Jekyll to maintain relationships between people pages?
* Can Wiki pages be used to discuss and coordinate and document ongoing research?
* Can Wiki pages be tied to and/or linked to other Jekyll pages and project/people files?
